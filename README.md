# OCPP Cloud Connector

The OCPP Cloud Connector is a cloud based implementation of the Open Charge Point Protocol, the de-facto standard for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). The connector will supply a web socket connection in accordance with the specification and transform OCPP protocol specific messaging into a generic set of messages and events, allowing a developer or company to easily integrate EVSE control into new or existing infrastructure.
